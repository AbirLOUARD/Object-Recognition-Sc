## Introduction

Object recognition aims to identify any object in an image database or a video. This identification is carried out thanks to attributes describing the shape, the color and the texture. We have 4 classes of objects (road signs, characters, cars and trucks). For each class we have 6 different objects and each object will be represented according to 5 angles of view. One object of each class will be used to build the learning base, and the other 5 objects of the class will be used to test the relevance of the characterization. The learning base consists of 20 images (5 images per class) and the test base of 100 images (25 images per class).
